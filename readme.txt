Exercise for Front-End Profiles:

During the next weeks you will be working with a specific project. This project has all the functionality that we already seen and they are typical in all websites/platforms.

Your task
- Develop/cereate an e-commerce, with shopping cart and the same functionalities as in the bookstore and cart exercice.
- Each product has to have minimum this properties:
    Title, subtitle, images, description, category, price.
- Timming: 2 weeks to deliver using pure JS (Aprox.)
- Discount: every 4 products you buy you have to apply a discount. (pay 3 receive 4). If you buy more than 5 items in total a 10% discount is apllied to the total price.

Minimum requirements:

Create a json with the necessary data for each book. You can use real APIs like Google Books or Amazon. Or you can create your own JSON with your own tematic (The structure has to respect the minimum properties.)
You can modify the original JSON of the Bookstore exercise but modifying it with more properties, besides the one described previously you can use price, theme, stock and others ...
The json must be hosted in a real URL and must be accessed via fetch.
The user must be able to visualize all the products, filter them by properties (theme, title, price â€¦) or several combinations.
Each product must be added to the shopping cart and the user can know at all times how many products are in the cart and the price.
In the same way you can remove the products from the car.
The discount condition in the total price will be the same as described before. The 4th free product and discount for the number of items.
The design must be professional and respoonsive to all screens (Specific CSS for mobile, tablet and desktop)
No mistakes are accepted in the long term. Remember your platform has to keep working even if we add 1000 products.
No login needed (For now...)
